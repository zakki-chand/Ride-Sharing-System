# Ride-Sharing-System

This project implements a class-based Ride Sharing System using Smalltalk and C++, demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. The system is structured around core classes like Ride, Driver, and Rider, with specialized subclasses, StandardRide and PremiumRide, to manage different ride types. The design focuses on modular, maintainable code, ensuring flexibility for future extensions like additional ride categories or user customization, all while maintaining consistent functional behavior across platforms.
